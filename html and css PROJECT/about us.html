<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>
 Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br>
 when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <br></p>
 
 <p> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,<br>
 remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets<br>
 containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker <br>
 including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
