 <h1> I love learing how to link the html pages </h1>
 <h2> now comes the hardest of them all css </h2>
 <div class="p">
 <p> At first i did not understand anyting about information technolodgy.<br>my first day was a nightmare because i didnt even know most function of a computer.<br>it took me weeks to understand.
  Due to my pride of not asking for help i was left behind.during break i had no friends to chill with .i was alonly bird.</p>
</div>
  <p> Weeks went by not used to anything or anyone ,everyday we were given task to do  here i was lost in my own world not kowing what to do and not to do,<br> because i was so afraid even to raise a hand and ask a simple question 
like how do we apply this element or attribute.i felt like i was being punished for my forfathers sins because wow it was so hectic</p>

<p> after 2 weeks i mastered how to use a computer but i was left behind with school work<br> , had to understand what exatly a programmer do
 and even understand whta my course means because i did not know what an inforamation technology does.</p>  
 
 <p>now you wont even know that i didnt understand because i mastered everything in html only left with the css<br> ,jaivascript and other codind patforms.
 when it comes to the css im a slow learnr but i will get there as time goes </p>
